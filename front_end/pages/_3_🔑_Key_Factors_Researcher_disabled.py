"""
This page is intentionally hidden from Streamlit navigation by virtue of its
leading underscore in the filename. It preserves the Key Factors Researcher
implementation in the repository while preventing end-users from accessing it
from the sidebar. When you are ready to re-enable the feature, simply rename
this file back to `3_ðŸ”‘_Key_Factors_Researcher.py` (remove the leading
underscore) or copy its contents into a new visible page file.

Nothing is executed when Streamlit imports this file.
"""

# If you need to reference the original implementation for local testing or
# future re-enablement, you can import it like so:
# from forecasting_tools.front_end.disabled_pages.key_factors_researcher_full import main

# For now, we stop execution immediately so the page remains inert.
